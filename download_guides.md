### Python Packages
Open `terminal for macOS` or `windows prompt for Windows` and run the following commands:

!!! note "What's going on?"
    We are now installing packages using `pip` which stands for Python Package Manager.
    Since python is an open sourced programming language, many other developers have come up with amazing tools to enhance the use of python. These tools are what we call `packages` in which we use `pip` to manage those packages.
    To download a package using pip, we use a shell to interact with the computer.
    Opening `terminal` for macOS or `command prompt` for Windows:
        We run commands that look like this: `pip install <name of package>`
    TLDR: We download other people's code to use for our own so that we don't have to code out the same thing over and over again.

!!! note "Wait what is a shell?"
    Computers you use now have graphical interface in which we press buttons to make the computer do stuff.
    However, what if we want to do more than what the buttons can do?
    That's why we have a shell, a texted based interface which we use to interact with the computer.
